# Clima-weather-app
My first project using an API to get information from the internet to display on screen

A simple app to retreive the weather at the user's location or any destination the user enters. Can be used on any android device.
This is displays my knowloedge of working with an API, transitioning between multiple screens, and working with a user's location.
